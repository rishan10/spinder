### Our project
Spinder is an app that aims to introduce users to each other based on music taste, forming new friendships. Users will be able to choose genres of music that they enjoy, and will be prompted with songs from the specified genres. Songs will appear one at a time, and a user will tap the left arrow if they don't enjoy the song, and the right arrow if they do. When two users have tapped right on five of the same songs, they will be "matched". From here, users can reach out to their matches to start a new friendship!
